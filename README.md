# learning-go-by-building

A hands-on repository documenting my journey learning Go (Golang) by building small, production-style projects.

## Projects
- `event-ingest-service` — an HTTP service that accepts JSON events, validates them, and (for now) logs them.

## Goals
- Learn idiomatic Go
- Understand concurrency and parallelism
- Build and structure services using the standard library
- Practise clean error handling and testable design
