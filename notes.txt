1) & and * symbols are about memory and ownership 
2) & asks for an 'object'/value/struct to be created, returning the pointer to it 
3) & is the address operator used to get the memory address of a variable
4) * is the defrerencing operator, used for both declaration and access/modification at a pointer's memory address.
5) Data does not need to be copied to methods/functions, which improves performance and memory efficiency. 
6) Read up on automatic defrerencing
7) &value      → address of value, *Type       → pointer to Type, *ptr        → value at pointer
8) The http.ServeMux is Go's built-in HTTP request multiplexer (or router) found in the standard library's net/http package. It matches incoming HTTP request URLs against a list of registered patterns and calls the appropriate http.Handler for the most closely matching pattern. 
9) The Go community values short, concise functions, which naturally leads to the use of shorter variable names within those limited scopes.
